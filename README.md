# Spotify Dataset Analysis using SQL 

![Spotify Logo](https://github.com/najirh/najirh-Spotify-Data-Analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/spotify_logo.jpg)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Spotify music dataset using SQL to understand track performance, artist trends, and engagement metrics. The goal of this project was to strengthen my SQL skills by working with a real-world dataset and applying concepts such as data exploration, aggregation, window functions, and query optimization.

The project covers the complete workflow — from understanding the dataset structure to writing optimized SQL queries and extracting meaningful insights.

##  Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle – Spotify Dataset  

Data Type: Structured CSV data  

Key Attributes:  

Artist, Track, Album, Album Type  

Audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, etc.)  

Engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, streams)  

Flags such as licensed and official_video  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
Database: PostgreSQL  

Query Language: SQL  

SQL Concepts Applied:  

Filtering & Aggregations  

GROUP BY & HAVING  

Subqueries & CTEs  

Window Functions  

Indexing & Query Optimization  

Tool: pgAdmin 4

##  Project Approach
Explored and understood the dataset structure and columns  

Created database tables and imported the dataset  

Wrote SQL queries categorized into:  

Easy (basic filtering and counts)  

Medium (aggregations and grouping)  

Advanced (CTEs, window functions, optimization)  

Analyzed query performance using EXPLAIN ANALYZE  

Improved performance by applying indexing techniques

##  Key Business Questions Answered
Which tracks have more than 1 billion streams?  

What are the top 5 tracks with the highest energy levels?  

How does engagement differ for official vs non-official videos?  

Which artists and albums generate the highest views?  

How do audio features like energy and liveness vary across albums?  

---

##  Query Optimization
To understand performance tuning, I analyzed query execution plans using EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

Measured execution and planning time for queries  

Created indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., artist)  

Compared query performance before and after indexing  

Observed significant reduction in execution time after optimization  

This helped me understand how indexing impacts query performance on large datasets.
